When developing meowrch, we aimed to create a hotkey system that wasn't just a set of commands to memorize, but a logical and intuitive system based on associations. Our goal is to make you **understand** the key logic rather than mechanically memorizing them.

## Core Principle: Super as the Foundation

The **Super** key (also known as Windows/Command key) is the central key of the entire meowrch system. It's always the base for system actions and environment management.

<Aside type="tip">
**Remember:** Super is your main tool for interacting with the system. All primary actions start with it.

## Letter Associations: Think, Don't Memorize

Each letter combined with Super is chosen deliberately — it should create a direct association with the action:

### System Actions (Super + letter)

- **Super + A** = **A**pps — opens application menu
- **Super + W** = **W**allpaper — changes desktop wallpaper
- **Super + T** = **T**heme — switches color theme
- **Super + C** = **C**olor — color picker to identify colors on screen
- **Super + L** = **L**ock — locks the screen
- **Super + P** = **P**in — pins window on top of others
- **Super + N** = **N**otifications — notification history
- **Super + B** = **B**ar — show/hide panel
- **Super + E** = **E**xplorer — opens file manager
- **Super + Q** = **Q**uit — closes active window
- **Super + K** = **K**ill — force kills window process
- **Super + X** = e**X**it — shutdown/reboot menu

<Aside type="note">
Notice: even when the letter isn't in the first position (like X in exit), it still strongly associates with the English concept. This helps with internationalization.
</Aside>

## Modifiers: Action Levels

### Super + Shift: Launch Specific Applications

When you add **Shift** to Super, you move to the launch level for specific applications. Associations by first letter still apply:

- **Super + Shift + F** = **F**irefox
- **Super + Shift + C** = **C**ode (code editor)
- **Super + Shift + T** = **T**elegram
- **Super + Shift + O** = **O**bsidian (notes)
- **Super + Shift + P** = **P**avucontrol (audio mixer)
- **Super + Shift + Y** = **Y**azi (terminal file manager)
- **Super + Shift + B** = toggle **B**ar (mewline/waybar)

<Aside type="tip">
**Simple logic:** Super performs system action, Super + Shift launches application. The letter always hints at the name.
</Aside>

### Super + Ctrl: Navigate Between Spaces

When you hold **Ctrl** with Super, you manage **workspaces**:

- **Super + Ctrl + ←/→** = switch between workspaces
- **Super + Ctrl + ↓** = jump to first empty workspace

**Logic:** Ctrl means "control" over the entire environment, not just a single window.

### Super + Shift + Ctrl: Move Windows

When you hold **all three keys** (Super + Shift + Ctrl), you get maximum control — **physical window movement** with arrow keys.

**Logic:** The more modifiers, the more "heavy" and precise the action you're performing.

## Arrows vs Numbers

### Arrows — for Focus and Movement

- **Super + ←/↑/→/↓** = move focus between windows
- **Super + Shift + ←/↑/→/↓** = resize window
- **Super + Shift + Ctrl + ←/↑/→/↓** = move window in space

### Numbers — for Workspaces

- **Super + 1-9** = switch to workspace by number
- **Super + Shift + 1-9** = move window to workspace

<Aside>
**Why?** Arrows are directions in 2D space (windows on screen), numbers are layers in 3D (workspaces as building floors).
</Aside>

## Alt: Alternative Actions

**Alt** in meowrch is used for actions that are "alternative" or "additional" to the main ones:

- **Alt + Enter** = fullscreen mode (alternative to normal size)
- **Alt + Tab** = switch between windows (classic alternative to arrow focus)
- **Alt + Shift** = change keyboard layout (alternative language)

## Special Keys: Obvious Actions

Some keys are so obvious they don't require associations:

- **PrintScreen** = screenshot area
- **Super + PrintScreen** = screenshot entire screen
- **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** = task manager (like in Windows)
- **Super + Enter** = terminal (universal convention in tiling WMs)
- **Super + .** = emoji picker (like Windows and macOS)
- **Super + /** = hotkey cheatsheet (? = help)

## Memory Practice

Instead of rote memorization, try this approach:

1. **Think about the action** — what do you want to do?
2. **Take the first letter** — it's likely the key you need
3. **Add the appropriate level:**
   - Just Super = system action
   - Super + Shift = launch application
   - Super + Ctrl = workspace management
   - Super + Shift + Ctrl = window movement

<Aside type="caution">
**Exception:** Some combinations differ (like Super + Space for floating mode), but there are very few, and they'll quickly become muscle memory.
</Aside>

## Customization: Follow the Philosophy

When adding your own hotkeys, **follow the same philosophy**:

- Use Super as the base for system actions
- Choose letters that **associate** with the action
- Use Shift for launching applications
- Use Ctrl for actions affecting the entire environment
- Don't break existing patterns — it creates cognitive dissonance
