In today's world, the convenience and individuality of the workspace are more important than ever. 
The meowrch distribution has created a powerful and flexible customization system that allows you to control the appearance and behavior of many applications with a single command.

The central element of this system is [Pawlette](/en/customization/pawlette) — a universal theme manager. 
It unifies all settings in one place and allows smooth switching between themes while preserving unique user edits and preferences. 
Theme application covers window managers, panels, terminals, shells, and other key components of your system.

## Wallpaper Management

For complete immersion in desktop personalization, meowrch provides a convenient script for changing wallpapers:

```
~/.local/bin/set-wallpaper.sh
```

This script automatically selects the appropriate tool depending on the display server in use — `feh` for **X11** or `swww` for **Wayland** — providing a quick and seamless way to update the desktop background.

### How to Set Current Wallpapers

The system maintains a symbolic link to active wallpapers, 
making it easy to restore or reapply them using the command:

```
~/.local/bin/set-wallpaper.sh --current
```

The link to current wallpapers is located at:

```
~/.local/share/wallpapers/.current.wall
```

### Adding Theme-Independent Wallpapers

If you want to expand your wallpaper collection and use them regardless of selected themes, 
simply copy the images to the directory:

```
~/.local/share/wallpapers/
```

For convenient wallpaper selection, you can use the Rofi-based graphical interface, available through the script:

```
~/.local/bin/rofi-menus/wallpaper-selector.sh
```

## Using XDG Standards

Meowrch actively supports and promotes the XDG standard, which defines where configuration files, cache, and data should be stored in a Linux system. This ensures:

- Cleanliness of the user's home directory
- Unified way of storing configuration files for different applications
- Compatibility with most modern Linux systems and utilities

### What is XDG?

XDG is a specification that defines standard paths for storing configurations, cache, data, and other application files. It helps applications and users organize files conveniently and consistently.

### XDG + Meowrch

The following environment variables that affect file locations are set in meowrch:

```bash
shenv ZDOTDIR "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zsh"
```

- This variable tells the zsh shell that its configuration files are located in a path corresponding to the environment variable `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zsh`, which usually means `~/.config/zsh`.

```bash
shenv GTK2_RC_FILES "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"
```

- Sets the location of the gtk2 configuration file so that GTK applications can read appearance settings from the correct directory.

```bash
shenv XCURSOR_PATH "/usr/share/icons:$XDG_DATA_HOME/icons"
```

- Establishes search paths for mouse cursor themes, combining the system directory and user icon folder.

```bash
shenv CARGO_HOME "$XDG_DATA_HOME/cargo"
```

- Path for Rust package manager (cargo) data, compliant with XDG standard.

```bash
shenv CUDA_CACHE_PATH "$XDG_CACHE_HOME/nv"
```

- Path for Nvidia CUDA cache.

```bash
shenv GNUPGHOME "$XDG_DATA_HOME/gnupg"
```

- Directory for GnuPG key files.

```bash
shenv REDISCLI_HISTFILE "$XDG_DATA_HOME/redis/rediscli_history"
```

- Path for Redis client command history.

```bash
shenv RUSTUP_HOME "$XDG_DATA_HOME/rustup"
```

- Directory for the Rustup utility.

```bash
shenv NODE_REPL_HISTORY "$XDG_DATA_HOME/node_repl_history"
```

- History file for NodeJS REPL.

```bash
shenv PYENV_ROOT "$XDG_DATA_HOME/pyenv"
```

- Path for Python version manager pyenv.

```bash
shenv WAKATIME_HOME "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wakatime"
```

- Configuration directory for the Wakatime plugin.

### Why is This Important?

- Thanks to working through the XDG standard, your settings and configurations are always stored in uniform and predictable locations.
- This simplifies backup, synchronization, and sharing of settings between different machines.
- Improves compatibility with other Linux distributions and programs using the same standard.
