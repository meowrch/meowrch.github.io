## 🔄 Git-based Version Management

Pawlette automatically creates an internal Git repository to track changes:

<Aside type="note" title="How it works">
- **Each theme** = separate branch in Git
- **User changes** are saved as uncommitted changes  
- **Theme switching** automatically saves your settings
- **Change history** is available through Pawlette commands
</Aside>

### Checking Status

```
pawlette status
# ➤ Current theme: catppuccin-mocha  
# ⚠️  You have 3 uncommitted changes
# Modified files:
#   - kitty/kitty.conf
#   - waybar/config.json
#   - hypr/hyprland.conf
```

### Viewing History

```
pawlette history
# 📜 History for theme: catppuccin-mocha
# 👤 a1b2c3d Personal font settings [USER]

```

## 🔗 Automatic Symlink Creation

When applying a theme, Pawlette automatically creates symbolic links:

<Aside type="note" title="Created symlinks">
- **GTK themes**: `~/.themes/` → symlink to `gtk-theme/` from theme
- **Icons**: `~/.icons/` → symlink to `icons/` from theme  
- **Wallpapers**: `~/.local/share/pawlette/theme_wallpapers/` → symlink to `wallpapers/` from theme
</Aside>

### Debugging Issues

- For theme application issues, use `pawlette restore`
- To reset a theme to its original state: `pawlette reset-theme <name>`
- Check logs and status after each change
- Use `pawlette user-changes` to view your modifications

### Compatibility

<Aside type="caution" title="Important to remember">
Pawlette uses only Git for version management — no external backups are created. All changes are tracked through the internal Git repository.
</Aside>

The Pawlette system makes customizing meowrch simple and safe, allowing you to easily experiment with the system's appearance without risk of losing important settings.
