Running games on Linux requires not only compatibility but also proper optimization to achieve maximum performance.

Meowrch offers its own solution to automate this process — **MeowrchGameRun**, 
a tool that analyzes games and applies optimal settings without manual intervention.

Unlike traditional approaches with `gamemoderun` or `prime-run`, **MeowrchGameRun** uses intelligent analysis of executable files, detects the technologies used, and automatically selects the necessary optimizations for each specific game.

## Key Features:

Automatic optimization detection:
-  Analysis of executable files for game engines (Unity, Unreal, Godot, Source)
-  Detection of graphics APIs used (OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX)
-  DLSS and FSR support detection
-  Analysis of libraries and DLL files in the game directory
-  Launcher detection (Steam, Lutris)

Smart optimizations:
-  DLSS: Automatically enabled when NVIDIA GPU and DLSS support in game are present
-  Zink: Enabled for old OpenGL games when Vulkan support is available
-  Prime: Automatically applied on systems with discrete NVIDIA graphics card
-  GameMode: Disabled by default (can harm performance), enabled only when explicitly specified
-  Power profiles: Automatically switches to performance mode

## How to Install?
To install, you need to download the `meowrh-tools` package using the command
```bash
yay -Sy meowrch-tools
```

After that, the `meowrch-game-run` command will be available.

## Setting up in Steam
For a specific game
<Steps>
1. Open Steam
2. Find the desired game in the library
3. Right-click → "Properties"
4. In the "General" tab, find "Launch Options"
5. Enter `meowrch-game-run %command%`
</Steps>
