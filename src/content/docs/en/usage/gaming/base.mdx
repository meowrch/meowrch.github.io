Meowrch, like any other Arch Linux-based distribution, provides an excellent platform for gaming thanks to up-to-date packages, wide driver support, and the ability to fine-tune the system. 

This guide covers all aspects of setting up, running, and optimizing games on your Meowrch system.

## Installing Steam

Steam is the main gaming platform for Linux, providing access to thousands of games and built-in Proton support for running Windows games.

On Arch Linux, Steam is available in the official repositories:

```bash
# Enable the multilib repository (enabled by default on Meowrch)
sudo micro /etc/pacman.conf
```

Uncomment the following lines:
```
[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

Update the package database and install Steam:
```bash
sudo pacman -Sy steam
```

### First Launch and Setup

On first launch, Steam will:
1. Download and install necessary updates
2. Ask you to log into your Steam account
3. Set up your game library

### Enabling Proton in Steam

To run Windows games, you need to enable Proton:

1. Open Steam ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Compatibility
2. Enable "Enable Steam Play for all other titles"
3. Select a Proton version (latest stable or [Proton-GE-Custom](#installing-proton-ge) recommended)
4. Restart Steam

:::note[Other Launchers]
Besides Steam, there are other ways to run games (and other Windows applications) on Linux.

## Proton: Running Windows Games on Linux

Proton is a Wine fork developed by Valve specifically for Steam. It allows running Windows games on Linux with minimal configuration.

### What is Proton

Proton includes:
- **Wine** ‚Äî compatibility layer for running Windows applications
- **DXVK** ‚Äî DirectX 11/12 to Vulkan translation
- **VKD3D** ‚Äî DirectX 12 support
- **Valve patches** to improve game compatibility

### Proton Versions

- **Proton Stable** ‚Äî stable version for most games
- **Proton Experimental** ‚Äî experimental version with latest improvements
- **[Proton-GE-Custom](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom)** ‚Äî community-modified version with additional patches

### Installing Proton GE

[Proton-GE-Custom](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) often works better than official Proton:

```bash
yay -Sy proton-ge-custom-bin
```

After installation, restart Steam, and the new version will appear in the compatibility list.

## Checking Game Compatibility

Before buying a game, it's important to check its compatibility with Proton.

### ProtonDB ‚Äî Compatibility Database

[ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) is a community database where players share their experience running games through Proton.

#### Compatibility Ratings:

- **ü•á Platinum** ‚Äî game runs perfectly without configuration
- **ü•à Gold** ‚Äî game runs great with minimal configuration
- **ü•â Silver** ‚Äî game runs well with some configuration
- **üî∂ Bronze** ‚Äî game runs but with noticeable issues
- **üíî Borked** ‚Äî game doesn't run or has critical errors

#### How to Use ProtonDB:

1. Search for the game you're interested in
2. Read user reviews
3. Pay attention to recommended launch parameters
4. Check information about necessary additional components
