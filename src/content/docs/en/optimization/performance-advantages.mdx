---

Meowrch is a high-performance Linux distribution based on Arch that comes with a set of system optimizations to improve speed, responsiveness, and stability. All settings are automatically applied by the `meowrch-settings` package and are designed for safe operation on modern hardware.

## Key Advantages

### üöÄ Instant System Response

**ZRAM with zstd compression** provides:
- 2-4x increase in effective RAM capacity
- Virtually zero latency when accessing "swap"
- No SSD wear from constant swap file writes
- Priority 100 ensures ZRAM usage instead of slow disk swap

### ‚ö° Optimized Disk Subsystem

**Intelligent I/O schedulers**:
- **SSD**: `none` scheduler eliminates unnecessary queue delays
- **HDD**: `mq-deadline` scheduler optimizes seek time and throughput
- Automatic storage type detection on each boot

### üéØ Aggressive Memory Management

**Optimized virtual memory parameters**:
- `vm.swappiness = 100` ‚Äî maximum utilization of fast ZRAM
- `vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50` ‚Äî keeps important VFS cache in memory
- `vm.dirty_bytes = 268435456` ‚Äî efficient write buffering (256MB)
- `vm.page-cluster = 0` ‚Äî SSD optimization without fragmentation

### üîß Real-time CPU Optimizations

**Dynamic processor management**:
- Automatic `performance` governor setting for all cores
- Transparent hugepages in `madvise` mode for optimal memory usage
- Defrag in `defer` mode prevents system lockups
- NMI watchdog disabled to reduce kernel overhead

## Protection Against System Failures

### üõ°Ô∏è EarlyOOM ‚Äî Smart Freeze Protection

**Out-of-Memory situation prevention**:
- Real-time memory usage monitoring
- Triggers at 5% free RAM / 10% free swap
- Critical process protection: `init`, `systemd`, `Xorg`, `NetworkManager`
- Priority termination of resource-heavy applications: browsers, IDEs, games

This means your system will **never freeze** due to memory shortage ‚Äî EarlyOOM will properly free resources before a critical situation.

## Network Performance

### üåê Optimized Network Subsystem

- `net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 4096` ‚Äî increased packet buffer
- RPS (Receive Packet Steering) distributes load across all CPU cores
- Network queue optimization for multithreading
- Reduced latency and increased throughput

## Gaming Performance

### üéÆ GPU and PCI Optimizations

**NVIDIA optimizations**:
- Persistence mode for stable driver operation
- Automatic setting of maximum GPU and VRAM frequencies
- Minimized microstutters in games

**AMD optimizations**:
- Manual frequency control mode
- Maximum performance level by default

**PCI Latency optimization**:
- Special `pci-latency.service` service
- Minimized latency for all PCI devices
- Critical for gaming mice, sound cards, network adapters

## Fast System Boot

### ‚è±Ô∏è Boot Optimizations

**Boot process acceleration**:
- `NetworkManager-wait-online.service` disabled ‚Äî saves 5-15 seconds
- `plocate-updatedb` moved to timer instead of service at boot
- Optimized systemd timeouts
- Parallel service initialization

**Result**: boot to desktop in **10-15 seconds** on modern SSD.

## Security Without Performance Loss

### üîí Balanced Security

- `kernel.kptr_restrict = 2` ‚Äî protection against kernel address leaks
- `kernel.kexec_load_disabled = 1` ‚Äî protection against kexec attacks
- `kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone = 1` ‚Äî container support
- `kernel.printk = 3 3 3 3` ‚Äî kernel output optimization

## Comparison with Other Distributions

### üìä Practical Advantages

| Parameter | Vanilla Arch | Ubuntu/Fedora | Meowrch |
|----------|--------------|---------------|---------| 
| Boot time | 20-30 sec | 30-45 sec | **10-15 sec** |
| RAM usage (idle) | 800MB+ | 1.2GB+ | **600MB** |
| System responsiveness | Good | Average | **Excellent** |
| Gaming performance | Basic | Basic | **Optimized** |
| OOM protection | No | Partial | **Full** |
| SSD optimization | Manual | Basic | **Automatic** |

## Automatic Application

### üîÑ meowrch-settings Package

All optimizations are applied **automatically** during system installation via the `meowrch-settings` package:

```bash
# Check optimization status
sudo systemctl status meowrch-optimizations.service
sudo systemctl status pci-latency.service  
sudo systemctl status systemd-zram-setup@zram0.service

# Manual application (if needed)
sudo systemctl start meowrch-optimizations.service
```

### üìà Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Check ZRAM usage
zramctl

# Memory monitoring
free -h

# EarlyOOM status
journalctl -u earlyoom.service -f

# Check I/O scheduler  
cat /sys/block/*/queue/scheduler
```

## Conclusion

Meowrch offers **scientifically-based optimizations** founded on Linux community best practices and proven solutions from CachyOS. Each setting targets specific performance improvements without compromising stability.

**Result**: a fast, responsive system that maximally utilizes your hardware and will never let you down at a critical moment.
